If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Answer:
I could characterize the aura of the listener with the given definition of aura. It said if aura only contains energy, danceability and valence,
so basically I could calculate the average of that three variable with SQL as the course already discussed to querying. After that I can now
conclude the listener aura based on the calculated average.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Answer:
Those variable is not enough to defining aura of the listener, maybe we can say that danceability, valence and energy are enough but it's not.
Why? Because those variable mmight not capture all nuances ofo a listener musical preferences, there are many other aspects than that such as
lyrical sentiment, genre or maybe their habis. So my hypothesize is there are many more aspects we must consider than just energy, valence and danceability.
Another way to solve that if I could say is using technology called machine learning to determine the aura of the listener.
